# Quality-of-Bread-Classification
Classified the quality of bread (numerically represented between 3-8) into three categories - Low, Medium and Good

Our quality of bread dataset consisted of 12 variables including dependent variables (i.e. quality of bread). 

### Step 1

Identified the top three parameters in correlation with the quality of bread using correlation matrix. 
The top three factors are:-
1. Alcohol Content
2. Sulphates Content
3. Volatile Acidity 

Increase in the alcohol content of the mixture increase the quality of bread as seen in the figure below:

Similarily, an increase in the sulphates content of the mixture increase the quality of bread as seen in the figure below:

However, an increase in the volatile acidity of the mixture decreased the quality of bread as seen in the figure below:
