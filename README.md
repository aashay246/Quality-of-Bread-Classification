# Quality-of-Bread-Classification
Classified the quality of bread (numerically represented between 3-8) into three categories - Low, Medium and Good

Our quality of bread dataset consisted of 12 variables including dependent variables (i.e. quality of bread). 

### Step 1

Identified the top three parameters in correlation with the quality of bread using correlation matrix.

The top three factors are:-
1. Alcohol Content
2. Sulphates Content
3. Volatile Acidity 

#### For better visualization of the relation between the three predictors and the quality of bread, we used box plot approach as all variables are continuous variables.

1. Increase in the alcohol content of the mixture increase the quality of bread as seen in the figure below:

2. Similarily, an increase in the sulphates content of the mixture increase the quality of bread as seen in the figure below:

3. However, an increase in the volatile acidity of the mixture decreased the quality of bread as seen in the figure below:
